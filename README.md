*Every problem has a solution; the important thing is to ask the right questions, to learn continuously and to find the most efficient way to break the problem down into its component parts. Don't waste time over-planning, just start somewhere - the rest will come.*

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Emre! 

## About Me
AI Engineer | CUDA-Crafter | LLM Builder

I build intelligent systems from the ground up â€” whether it's building high-performance CUDA kernels, optimizing YOLO-based vision models, or deploying LLM-powered assistants.

I thrive where complexity meets clarity: turning prototypes into products, and abstract ideas into code that works. My current focus? Scaling AI-native tools for real-world automation and emotional intelligence â€” from smart factories to therapeutic AI companions.

## What I Do
- Developing **AI-powered automation** systems.  
- Working with **computer vision** and object detection models.  
- Creating modular libraries for **model training and inference**.  

## Other Interests
- Training and fine-tuning **LLMs** for different applications.  
- Enhancing **model efficiency** for production environments.  
- 100 Days of CUDA Challenge â€“ **Learning & implementing CUDA.**
- Contributing to open-source AI projects
